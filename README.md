HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor:
My Task: My task was to take an existing code for a website and refactor it to make the site more accessible.

The Fix: 
I added HTML semantic elements instead of using the divs
I added changed the title element to be related to the website
I made sure that the links on the site function correctly
I organized the CSS styles sheet, made sure that it was structured
I consolidated the CSS elements
I added Alts attributes to IMG elements

Why did I build this project:
It's great practice and making a site more accessible/organized is helpful for screenwriters, people with disabilities, etc.
It makes everything easier for everyone.

Resources I used:
I mostly used the information I was given from my class and I used "MDN Web Docs" and "W3schools".
